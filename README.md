# A set of scripts used to parse Makerbot Cloud Print's reports
All the scripts are pretty self-evident on what they do. They all have their usage in comments

Because SQLite, the file names you pass in must not contain a space (if someone knows how to get the quoting right so it can use spaces, please open a pull request!)

# Contributing
If you have anything to add or issues to bring up, please either create and issue or pull request on [github](https://github.com/gunqqer/makerbotScripts)
